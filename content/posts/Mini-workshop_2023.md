Our group are planning the next mini-workshop with the topic „A Benchmark Suite for Data Placement in Operating Systems“. We all agree that a system can only grow if it is challenged with suitable, real-world benchmarking workloads. Hence, with this initiative, our group aims at creating a configurable benchmarking suite that is a Swiss army knife for challenging modern heterogeneous memory setups to validate each project’s specific goals and create a base of comparison between projects. For example, how much does the use of NVM in Project X contribute to performance improvements when compared to Project Y which focuses on safety and based on these results which actors might benefit from the former or the latter approach?  
Of course, there is a variety of benchmarks already available with varying end goals and emulated workloads. We should leverage their capabilities and specific challenges that they set already and evaluate what a common benchmark should encompass especially regarding the diverse metrics of performance, energy usage, operation costs etc. The specific goal of this mini-workshop is, thus, to analyze the state of the art and afterward create our own configurable benchmark that we can use within the SPP, but especially publish it for external competitions and benchmarking purposes.
The agenda of this mini-workshop is rather special because it starts with a preparation phase before the in-person workshop. In the preparation phase, we ask you to create together with us a knowledge base of existing benchmarks. Afterward, we structure the material and distribute the presentations about benchmarks for the mini-workshop among the participants. After some presentation slots, we aim to get our hands dirty with conceptualizing or, at best, implementing the benchmark suite.

The workshop will take place in Magdeburg from 6th to 7th of July 2023 as two half-day workshop days. The rationale behind this is that, in the evening of the first day, we can engage in implementation activities (similar to a hackathon).
