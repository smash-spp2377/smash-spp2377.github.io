Our first meeting to distill the findings from the workshop into a paper *The SPP-hikers Guide to Memory Benchmarks* - the idea from _Timo Hönig_ and _Sven Köhler_ (Memento) - will be held on July 24, 2023.

The details of the meeting will be shared with the participants via their registered email addresses.
